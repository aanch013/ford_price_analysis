# Ford F150 Price Analysis
In this project, I explored between certain attributes of a vehicle and its sale data by identifying common patterns through statistical analysis and visualizations. I chose to visualize the relationship that I felt was most relevant, which was the relationship between the year the vehicle was made and selling price. The graph can be found in the pdf file.
